Bugfix: Enabling Markup Mode, Showing Video Controls on iOS 16, Updating Theme

Enabling markup mode was broken on iOS 16 because of rearranged navigation bar and toolbar items.
Video player controls were not showing on iOS 16.
Furthermore when a new theme was chosen, this causes that the UITabBar and UIToolbar does not updates colours.
