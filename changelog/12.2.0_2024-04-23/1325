This PR implements password policy support throughout the iOS client app, including:
- an extensible password policy system based on rules, policies and validation reports with verbose error reporting for
   - characters and [character sets](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscharacterset)
   - lengths
   - byte counts
- the generation of password policies based on server capabilities
- a default password policy for servers that do not provide a password policy
- a password generator based on password policy rules using "[cryptographically secure random    bytes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/1399291-secrandomcopybytes)"
- a password composer for entering, editing and generating passwords with instant rule verification and feedback
- one-tap password generation based on a server's password policy within Public Link creation
- sharing of combined public link URL and password to the clipboard, Messages, Mail and more via the system share sheet directly after link generation, like f.ex.:
