== Security

=== Passcode 

To protect access to the iOS app with a Passcode, enable btn:[Passcode Lock] in the Setting's Security section.
You will then be prompted to enter, and repeat, a 4-digit Passcode.

=== Lock Delay

When a Passcode is enabled, the app will be locked every time you change to another application.
However, under menu:Settings[Security > Lock application], you can choose to only lock the application after 1, 5, or 30 minutes, instead of "_immediately_", which is the default.

=== Biometrical Lock

After a Passcode has been created, a Biometrical Lock, or Touch ID, can also be used to gain access to the app.
To enable it enable btn:[Touch ID] in the Setting's _Security_ section, and then enter your 4-digit Passcode.
The next time you need to authorise access to the app, you will be able to enter either your Passcode, or use your stored biometrical data.

=== System Appearance (up from iOS 13)

When System Appearance is selected, ownCloud will automatically use the selected iOS system theme (light or dark) to reflect the system UI. Setting System Appearance is only available up from iOS 13.

== Logging

The ownCloud iOS app has built-in logging functionality, available under menu:Settings[Logging].

== Media Upload (Conversion)

When image and video files are uploaded, they can be converted to the industry-standard JPEG and MP4 respectively.
This is not done by default.
