== Managed App Config

Starting with iOS 7, Apple added support for {mdm-protocol-ref-url}[managed application configuration]. 
An MDM server can push a configuration to the iOS App. 
The app can access the configuration using the `NSUserDefaults` class. 
The configuration is basically a key-value dictionary provided as a `.plist` file.

== AppConfig XML Schema

{appconfig-xml-format-url}[The XML format], developed by AppConfig community, makes it easy for developers to define and deploy an app configuration. 
It not only supports configuration variables having default values, but also provides a configuration UI description, which can be interpreted by the tool and which generates a plist file. 
Moreover, specfile XML is consistently supported by major EMM vendors.

== Example: Deployment with MobileIron

1. Open https://appconfig.jamfresearch.com[AppConfig Generator].
2. Upload a specfile.xml.
3. Change the configuration options.
4. Download the generated plist file (ManagedAppConfig).
5. Open MobileIron Core.
6. Navigate to menu:Policies and Configs[Add New > Apple > iOS/tvOS > Managed App Config]
7. Upload the generated plist and specify name, bundle ID, and description
